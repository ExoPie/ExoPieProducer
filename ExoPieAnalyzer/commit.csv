syntax; bbvX.YZ.AB
X.YZ: this is the version of the skimmer, just copy it from there
AB; version of the Analyzer. With each time you run the analyzer on condor increase this number by 1 and write the edit comments

Once you have pushed the code to repository

create a new tag using:
git tag bbv0.00.01

push the new tag using:
git push origin bbv0.00.01

bbv0.00.01; keeping this as the base tag; changes for the tau veto discriminator are done

bbvXX.YY.01: * configured for year 2018: condor submission
	* changed the condor flag
	* changed the year varibale for 2018
